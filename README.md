# nudge
social group app - send nudges to your friends and family

#instructions:

cd into backend and run the following:
 - npm init
 - npm install bcrypt express firebase-admin jsonwebtoken lodash mongoose nodemon
 - npm start
open a new terminal and cd into backend again, and run the following: 
 - ngrok
 - copy the forwarding link and replace the one in ./frontend/api/linker.js
open a new terminal and cd into frontend (last one I promise) and run the following:
 - expo start
 - set the mode to tunnel (just in case you aren't connected to the same wifi)
 - install the expo go app on your phone
 - scan the qr code with your camera app and open the link with expo go
 - run and enjoy!
